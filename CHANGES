1999/10/01

Changed the Show() method so that it is now compatible with Tk800.015 as well
as earlier Tk800 versions.

1999/09/21

I've now had a go at adding 'de' (german) and 'fr' (french) as valid -language
options - translations by Babelfish so please let me know if they're wrong!

1999/09/11  

Added -language option so that the title and labels will come up in the
language you've chosen. Current language is english, 'en'. If people supply
translations I will add them. 

1999/09/06  

Reinstated the test program, it is now called `example'. NB This module is
incompatible with Tk800.015 (which I believe is broken); it works fine with
earlier Tk8 and Tk4 versions and is expected to work with Tk800.016 onwards.

1999/09/04  

Removed ColourChooser.t - it was only a simple example but being interactive
messes up CPAN's automatic testing. Plus tiny fixes.

1999/09/01  

Added Makefile.PL.

1999/08/29  

Minor code changes.

1999/08/08  

Changed licence to LGPL.

1999/08/05  

Just changed the files to make them more CPAN friendly.

1999/04/21  

Updating the colour when you move the scrollbar with the mouse is buggy --
can't figure out why so have reverted.

1999/03/02  

Now when you scroll with the scrollbar both the colourname and the colour
shown are updated (the same as when you move up and down with the arrow keys).

1999/02/23  

Should now be Windows compatible.

1999/02/17  

If a colour is given as lowercase hex it is now properly recognised.

1999/02/15  

Improved handling of initial colour so that it copes better with the variety
of valid colour name inputs.

1999/01/29  

First version.
